# ML-SAGE-COF-Protocol
ML-SAGE-COF is a machine learning–surrogate assisted genetic exploration protocol for discovering base-functionalized COFs capable of stabilizing complementary Lewis acids and forming in situ FLP environments. It enables scalable chemical space exploration for CO₂ hydrogenation through ML-accelerated evolutionary search
